# Part 1
## Introduction
## Rules
## Integer
## Booleans
## Naturals
## Booleans and Naturals

## LC
- show that we have the bools in LC via if-then-else
- add Haskell code for the interpreter
- probably add a small bound tutorial into the mix

## STLC
- clean up
  - update T-Var so that it is an axiom
  - improve the animation of the typing derivation to match the bools-and-nats version
- add Haskell code for the checking and inference
- rip out the pairs etc...

## Conclusion
- write a lead in to Part 2

# Part 2
- review part 1, show that we can add pairs and tuples and things
- HM / System F / System Fw
- user defined data types, recursive types
