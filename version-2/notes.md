# Part 1
## Introduction
## Rules
## Integer
## Booleans
## Naturals
## Booleans and Naturals

## LC
- add Haskell code for the interpreter
- probably add a small bound tutorial into the mix

## STLC
- improve the animation of the typing derivation to match the bools-and-nats version
- add Haskell code for the checking and inference

##
- general: could cut down on number of unhighlighted sections during animations by making better use of slide specs

# Part 2
- HM / System F / System Fw
- user defined data types, recursive types, pattern matching
